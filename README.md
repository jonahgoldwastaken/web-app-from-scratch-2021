## Getting started

Before you get started, I advice you to read the [APIs used](#apis-used) section, as you need a Client ID for Spotify as well as an API key for Mapquest.

This project doesn't use any bundlers or dev servers. I would advice you to install [Browsersync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync) to serve the web content in this project. You install Browsersync either through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or any other NPM package manager of choice with global installation functionality.

```shell
$ npm install --global browser-sync || yarn global add browser-sync
```

Then proceed to clone this repository.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/theonejonahgold/web-app-from-scratch-2021 web-app
$ cd web-app
$ browser-sync -w -s --port 5000 # Starts a browser-sync server on port 5000 that watches for file changes in the current directory
```

## APIs used

The APIs used both have API keys. You can put these inside the contants folder, where all constant values reside.

### [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

The Spotify API is extremely expansive. From user information to the devices they can connect to, from artists to recommendations based on a certain song and artist. You can grab almost everything from this API, without any explicit rate limits.

[This page](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app) gives you information on how to create a Spotify Application on the Developer Platform.

If you have created one, be sure to set the redirect URIs to 'http://localhost:5000' and the URL you are hosting this app on.

### [Mapquest Directions API](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/directions-api/route/get/)

The Mapquest API is quite large, and has a lot of features related to mapping. We are only using the Directions API to see how long a trip takes.

This API has a rate limit of 150000 per month before you've got to pony up, so keep that in mind.

Create an account [here](https://developer.mapquest.com/user/register) and get your API key from the dashboard.
